        <p>This page focuses on the fundamentals of a strong resume. A well-structured resume uses hierarchy to guide the reader: name and contact at the top, a concise summary or title, a list of your most relevant experience with 2–4 bullet achievements per role (each answer the question “what did you do and what changed?”), and education/certifications. Aim for clarity over cleverness. Hiring managers and applicant tracking systems prefer predictable section titles: "Experience", "Education", "Skills", and "Projects".</p>

        <p>Practical tips: keep the top third of the page packed with your identity, headline, and one or two key achievements. Use numbers where possible: "increased retention by 12%," "managed a budget of $50k," or "scaled user base to 20k." For layout, use generous white space, readable fonts, and bold the elements you want the reader’s eye to find quickly. One-page resumes are ideal for early-career candidates. For senior candidates, two pages are acceptable if every line adds value.</p>

        <h2>Formatting checklist</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Readable font (10–12 pt for body).</li>
          <li>Consistent dates and location format.</li>
          <li>Action verbs at the start of bullets.</li>
          <li>Quantified outcomes when possible.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Finally, tailor for each role — small customizations to the summary and the top bullets make a big difference. Save as PDF for submissions unless a plain text CV is requested.</p>
