        <p>Cover letters are not a repeat of your resume — they are the story of why you and the organization fit. Open with a short line about why you care about the company's mission or the role, then give one or two short examples that show impact relevant to the job. Keep it to 3–5 short paragraphs. Use a friendly, professional tone: avoid clichés like "I am a hard worker," and instead show impact: "I coordinated a project that cut onboarding time by 30%."</p>

        <p>Structure: (1) Opening — why this company and role; (2) Evidence — 1–2 examples of relevant impact; (3) Close — an invitation for next steps and a note about availability. Customize the first paragraph to the company; the second paragraph should be about outcomes and metrics; the closing should be succinct and confident. If the application asks for a cover letter, always include one — it's an opportunity to explain transitions, career gaps, or unique motivations in your own voice.</p>

        <h2>Sample opening lines</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>"I’m excited about the opportunity to help [Company] scale its community support — I ran a similar program that grew active contributors 3x."</li>
          <li>"Your mission to make sustainable design accessible resonated with me — here’s how I led an affordable-design pilot."</li>
        </ul>
