        <p>A successful job search needs a plan. Start by identifying 2–3 target roles and industries that match your strengths — focus beats scatter. Create a simple tracker (spreadsheet or Trello) to log the company, role, application date, contact, status, and follow-up reminders. Customize each application: 2–3 tailored lines in your resume and a short cover note that highlights relevant experience will dramatically increase response rates compared to generic mass applications.</p>

        <p>Use a mix of channels: job boards for active roles, LinkedIn and company websites for direct applications, and networking for hidden roles. For every role you apply for, try to connect with a current or former employee to learn about the team; this informal intel often reveals whether a role is worth pursuing. Keep a weekly routine: 1–2 hours of targeted searching, 2–3 tailored applications, and 2 networking touches. This sustainable cadence prevents burnout and maintains momentum.</p>
