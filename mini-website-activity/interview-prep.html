        <p>Preparing for interviews is as much about mindset as content. Start by choosing 4–6 stories that demonstrate leadership, problem-solving, collaboration, and learning. Use the STAR framework (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to make answers concise and outcome-focused. For technical roles, code and whiteboard practice is important — simulate real constraints, time yourself, and explain your thinking out loud. For behavioral interviews, rehearse answers but avoid sounding robotic: record yourself and iterate and practice with a friend or mirror.</p>

        <p>Logistics matter: confirm time zones, test your tech (camera, mic, internet speed), pick a neutral background, and have a simple portfolio or sample ready to share. Before the interview, do a brief breathing exercise and revisit your top stories — 3 slow breaths resets your nervous system. Ask thoughtful questions at the end — about team culture, success metrics, or onboarding. These show curiosity and help you evaluate fit.</p>
