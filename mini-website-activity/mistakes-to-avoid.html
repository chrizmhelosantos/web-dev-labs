        <p>Many job seekers lose momentum due to avoidable mistakes. A few common ones: submitting generic resumes to many roles, failing to quantify achievements, letting online professional profiles go stale, and skipping follow-up after interviews. Another frequent misstep is not practicing interview storytelling — rehearsed but natural stories help maintain calm and clarity. If you find yourself stuck, choose one area (e.g., resume headlines) and iterate until it improves — small incremental improvements compound quickly.</p>

        <p>Recovering from a mistake often involves transparency and action: if you missed a deadline or interview, apologize, explain briefly, offer a solution, and follow through. If your resume received no hits, ask a mentor for 20 minutes of review and implement two recommended changes. Keep metrics: track how changes affect responses. Learning from mistakes, documenting what worked, and adapting will accelerate future success.</p>
