        <p>Networking shouldn’t feel like asking for favors — think of it as building a mutual support network. Start small: reach out to one person per week with a short, specific ask (e.g., "Could you share 10–15 minutes to learn how you structured your project team?"). When you ask for coffee chats, propose a clear time commitment and a short agenda. Always prepare: read the person's profile, prepare 2–3 questions, and be ready to offer something of value, even if small (a relevant article, an intro, or feedback).</p>

        <p>After conversations, send a short thank-you note highlighting what you learned and a concrete next step if appropriate. Keep an occasional pulse: a useful article, a congrats message on a new role, or a holiday note keeps relationships alive. Over time, caring consistency (not frequency) builds a network that will support referrals, advice, and partnerships.</p>
