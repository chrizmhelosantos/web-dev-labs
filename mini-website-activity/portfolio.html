        <p>Your portfolio should present a few strong projects rather than many small ones. Each project entry should answer: what problem did you solve, what was your role, what approach did you take, and what was the measurable impact? Include brief case study pages with screenshots, links, or short videos that demonstrate flow. For code-based portfolios, include a link to a working demo and the relevant GitHub repo with a helpful README that explains how to run the project.</p>

        <p>Presentation matters: fast load times, clear typography, and mobile-friendly layout will ensure reviewers can focus on substance. Add a short about page that summarizes your strengths, preferred technologies, and what kinds of problems you love solving. For creative roles, context and process make work more compelling — show sketches, early iterations, and short reflections on what you'd do differently. Finally, keep it fresh: prune older pieces and highlight recent or role-relevant work.</p>
